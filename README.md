# FocusGuard

**The only website blocker your future self can't outsmart.**

A Chrome extension that blocks distracting websites with smart anti-cheat protection. Unlike other blockers, FocusGuard makes you *wait* before unblocking — giving your willpower time to kick in.

## Features

- ⚡ **One-click blocking** - Block current site instantly
- ⏱️ **Timed blocks** - 15 minutes to 8 hours
- 📅 **Scheduled blocks** - Automatic blocking during work hours
- 🛡️ **Smart delay** - 5-15 minute wait to unblock (anti-cheat!)
- 🎨 **Beautiful block page** - Calming design with motivational quotes
- 📊 **Statistics** - Track your blocked attempts
- 🔒 **100% Private** - No data collection, works offline

## Why FocusGuard?

Other blockers fail because you can disable them the moment willpower drops. FocusGuard adds **intentional friction**:

1. You try to unblock YouTube
2. FocusGuard says "Sure, but wait 5 minutes"
3. In those 5 minutes, the urge usually passes
4. You stay focused
